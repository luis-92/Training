## Temas Principales



1. **Section 1: [Ai 900 - Azure AI Fundamentals]**
   - **Videos:**
    -  1
     	-  **Types of artificial intelligence:**
        - Azure Ai services
        - Open AI
        - Search
        - Vision
        - Speech
        - Language
        - Translator
        - Documents
        - Bots
        - Audio and Video
        - Decisions
        - Immersive reader
      - **What is ML model?**
        - A model will identify patterns, we need to test it and there are many ways to test it for the different models
      - **NOTES Azure**
        - Azure services are not longer named "cognitive services" those are called "Azure AI Services"
        - There are 5 sections for the certification
         - Describe AI and considerations
         - Fundamental principles
         - Computer vision
         - Natural language
         - fetures of genAI
        - All of them goes from 15 to 20% except for the fundamental principles  

3. **Section 2: Artificaion intelligence worloads and considerations**
   - **Videos:**
    -  1
     	-  **Common AI workloads**
        - **Machine learning workload** for predictions
         -  Training models to make predictions based on data. This is one of the core elements of AI and often forms the backbone of many AI systems.
         - for example using the visitoirs an sales table what I can see is in the next image

         - Using prediction models like google, netflix etc are examples of them suggesting series or searchs
         - Second thing that AI can do is Anomaly Detection
          - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9022a5e-777d-4771-92be-8eab89742013)
          - it can make a prediction based on anomaly detection
         - **Computer vision workload** is another thing that can do with AI
          - Create description of image
          - Identify faces
         - **Natural Language processing workload (NLP)**
          - related to this is Knowldege mining - cognitive search
          - Ingest content from blob storagesm tablesm,sl databases
         - Content moderator
          - Find proganity, hateful, offensive, violent or phishing and image. It will support multi langague you can ser the severity of the category

         - Gen AI
          - You can train bots to understand and create answers with new content based on a dataset. In other words it will create new content based on the dataset given to it.

     	-  **AI principles and ethics**
        - **Identify Unintended consequences**
        - -  Decisionas are wrong
          -  Decisionas are illegal or at least against the values
          -  ETC
          -  Example: Facial recognition racial bias problem, amazon scraps secert AI recruiting toolthat showed bias against women, millos of black people affected by racial bias en healtch care industry,  Calgary police face reconn can violate you privacy?
          -  What if the traffic control installs sensires in every interesectioinb to count cars, then install cameras and record the liucense plates, sounds good but waht if someone stole de info?
          -   **Six principles** in order to avoid that unintented consequences
