   - **Videos:**
    -  1
     	-  **Types of artificial intelligence:**
        - Azure Ai services
        - Open AI
        - Search
        - Vision
        - Speech
        - Language
        - Translator
        - Documents
        - Bots
        - Audio and Video
        - Decisions
        - Immersive reader
      - **What is ML model?**
        - A model will identify patterns, we need to test it and there are many ways to test it for the different models
      - **NOTES Azure**
        - Azure services are not longer named "cognitive services" those are called "Azure AI Services"
        - There are 5 sections for the certification
         - Describe AI and considerations
         - Fundamental principles
         - Computer vision
         - Natural language
         - fetures of genAI
        - All of them goes from 15 to 20% except for the fundamental principles  

3. **Section 2: Artificaion intelligence worloads and considerations**
   - **Videos:**
    -  1
     	-  **Common AI workloads**
        - Prediction and demand forecasting 
         - for example using the visitoirs an sales table what I can see is in the next image

        - Using prediction models like google, netflix etc are examples of them suggesting series or searchs
         - Second thing that AI can do is Anomaly Detection
          - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9022a5e-777d-4771-92be-8eab89742013)
          - it can make a prediction based on anomaly detection
         - Computer vision is another thing that can do with AI
          - Create description of image
          - Identify faces
         - Natural Language processing
          - related to this is Knowldege mining - cognitive search
          - Ingest content from blob storagesm tablesm,sl databases
         - Content moderator
          - Find proganity, hateful, offensive, violent or phishing and image. It will support multi langague you can ser the severity of the category

         - Gen AI
          - You can train bots to understand and create answers with new content based on a dataset. In other words it will create new content based on the dataset given to it.
